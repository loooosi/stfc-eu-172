§10 Rules for setting a player **KOS server - wide (Rogue players):**  
1. Every member of the council has the possibility to declare a player as "Server-KOS / Rogue" for a certain period of time. He proposes this to the Council. After three days of discussion, a vote will be drawn up. The vote is either YES or NO and lasts for three days. The vote then includes the question of whether this KOS setting is supported by the Council. A 66% majority of the voting Alliances (the result is commercially rounded to the nearest whole percent) is necessary for the proposal to be accepted.
 2. If the proposal is successful, all Alliances of the council undertake to set this player KOS within 24 hours after the end of the voting for the requested duration. Furthermore, all alliances will not accept this player for the duration of the KOS period as a member. If they fail to do so, they will also be set KOS after a warning.
3. At the end of the decided duration of the KOS period, all Alliances set the player or his Alliance to at least neutral (unless the player's alliance is set to KOS for other reasons). 
4. If "Unlimited" has been selected as the duration, any member of the council can submit an application for rehabilitation which should be including the reasons and conditions by which the request is based. This must also be confirmed by a 66% majority (the result is commercially rounded to the nearest whole percents) in a vote after at least three days of discussion, in which the conditions for full rehabilitation are also discussed. The rules from 3 then apply accordingly.
